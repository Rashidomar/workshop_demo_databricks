# ðŸ“š Databricks Lakehouse Workshop: Library Analytics Pipeline

Welcome to the hands-on workshop for learning **Databricks Lakehouse Architecture** using the analogy of a **Library System**. This end-to-end demo showcases how to build scalable data pipelines using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, and train a machine learning model to predict **late book returns**.
